# HXIS Integration Sandbox - NGEMR Development Environment

## Overview

The **Next Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR)** is Singapore‚Äôs national Electronic Medical Record platform, built on the Epic EMR system and used across public healthcare institutions. It is the backbone for safe, seamless, and coordinated patient care.

As a live production system, integration with NGEMR follows a well-defined and governed process designed to uphold stability, security, and interoperability across the healthcare ecosystem.
- It is guided by structured approval and review procedures that ensure all integrations meet operational and clinical standards.
- It is supported by established governance frameworks to align with national healthcare policies and data protection requirements.
- It operates on clear technical standards, including HL7, FHIR, and Epic interfaces, to maintain consistency and compatibility.

This structured approach safeguards the reliability of NGEMR while ensuring that any new integration delivers value, complies with standards, and supports the broader vision of a connected healthcare system.

To complement this process and facilitate early innovation, the **EMR Integration Sandbox** provides a production-like environment that simulates NGEMR, allowing innovators to:

- **Experiment and test integrations** without risk to live operations.
- **Validate and refine solutions early** using synthetic data and realistic workflows.
- **Accelerate readiness** for NGEMR integration, reducing rework and delays.

By bridging the gap between innovation and adoption, the EMR Integration Sandbox helps ideas move faster, safer, and more effectively into Singapore‚Äôs healthcare ecosystem.

### Purpose

The EMR Integration Sandbox is designed to:

- Provide an overview of NGEMR and the pathway to integrate with it.
- Offer a realistic EMR environment that simulates NGEMR for safe integration testing.
- Enable innovators to trial solutions with production-like interfaces, building confidence before engaging the live system.

### Playbook on EMR integration

This Playbook serves as a practical guide for innovators, outlining the steps to move from idea to production:
1. Introduction to NGEMR ‚Äì Understanding the national EMR system and its importance.
2. Testing integration in Sandbox ‚Äì Hands-on testing with preloaded data and standardized protocols (HL7, FHIR).
3. Integration using Epic APIs ‚Äì Practical pathways using both open and vendor-supported services.
4. Integration with NGEMR in Production ‚Äì Considerations, processes, and case studies for scaling into the real EMR environment.

### Feature Development Process

1. **Create NGEMR Feature Module**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/features/[ResourceName]/{components,hooks,services,types}
   ```

2. **Implement FHIR Service**
   ```typescript
   // src/services/[Resource]/[Resource]Service.ts
   export const resourceApi = createApi({
     endpoints: (builder) => ({
       getResourceList: builder.query(),
       createResource: builder.mutation(),
       updateResource: builder.mutation(),
       deleteResource: builder.mutation(),
     })
   });
   ```

3. **Add Tab Integration** (for new FHIR resources)
   ```typescript
   // Update src/common/hooks/useTabs.ts
   export const useResourceTabs = () => ({
     openResourceListTab: () => { /* Implementation */ },
     openResourceProfileTab: (id: string, name: string) => { /* Implementation */ }
   });
   ```

4. **Add Mock Data Generator**
   ```typescript
   // Generate realistic healthcare data
   export const generateMockPatients = (count: number) => { ... }
   ```

5. **Create UI Components**
   ```typescript
   // Healthcare-specific UI patterns with tab support
   export const ResourceListPage = () => { /* Tab-enabled list view */ }
   export const ResourceProfilePage = () => { /* Tab-enabled detail view */ }
   ```

6. **Write Integration Tests**
   ```typescript
   // Test FHIR compliance and data integrity
   describe('Patient Service', () => { ... })
   ```

## 6. Epic API Compatibility

### API Response Patterns

The sandbox mimics Epic's specific FHIR implementation patterns:

```typescript
// Epic-style Bundle response
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "Epic-search-result",
  "type": "searchset",
  "total": 150,
  "link": [
    {
      "relation": "self",
      "url": "Patient?_count=20&_offset=0"
    }
  ],
  "entry": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "id": "Epic-patient-123",
        "identifier": [
          {
            "system": "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.42.10001.100001.12",
            "value": "NRIC123456789"
          }
        ]
        // ... rest of patient data
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// Epic OAuth2 flow simulation
const authenticateWithEpic = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/auth/Epic/authorize', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    },
    body: 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=patient/*.read'
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

### Search Parameters

Epic-compatible search patterns:
```typescript
// Complex patient search
const searchPatients = {
  'given': 'John',
  'family': 'Doe',
  'identifier': 'NRIC|S1234567A',
  '_count': '50',
  '_offset': '0'
};
```
